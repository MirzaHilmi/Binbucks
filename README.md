BookHaven is a digital, web-based platform library designed to streamline the process of managing and tracking books in a physical library. This platform serves as a powerful tool for librarians worldwide, allowing them to efficiently organize their book inventory, track book availability, and manage borrower information. BookHaven is built entirely from scratch using a custom web framework developed exclusively with PHP vanilla, without relying on any external libraries or package managers. Its simplicity and independence make it accessible for anyone looking to enhance their library management system.

## Features

- **Book Search:** Users can easily search through a wide variety of books based on titles, authors, genres, or other criteria.

- **Book Information:** Detailed information about each book, including title, author, genre, and availability status, is readily accessible.

- **Inventory Management:** Librarians can manage their book inventory efficiently, adding new books, and marking books as borrowed or available.

- **Borrower Tracking:** The platform allows librarians to keep track of all borrowed books, including borrower details and due dates.

## Technology Stack

BookHaven is built using [Saphpi](https://github.com/MirzaHilmi/Saphpi) a custom web framework built with only PHP vanilla which happens to be my own framework so check it out! The decision to avoid external libraries or package managers emphasizes the platform's independence and ease of use for potential contributors and users.
